Deltacoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Litecoin, Deltacoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

# F.A.Q 
How many Deltacoins can exist?
There is a max supply of 333,966,600 Deltacoins.
Each subsequent block will grant 9,999 coins to encourage miners to continue to secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost encryption passwords/etc.

# Deltacoin mining information 
Deltacoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its proof of work with a target time of 10 minutes per block and difficulty readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed with a block halving at 16,700 blocks. A permanent reward of 4999.5 Deltacoin per block will be issued.
